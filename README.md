# StropheJS

## Build instructions

This branch of StropheJS uses the [Jake][2] build tool to compress the Javascript within the src/ folder.

You need to install CommonJS to be able to run Javascript from the command line. Currently this has only been tested with [Narwhal][1].

Once you have [Narwhal][1] installed you need to install [Jake][2] and [Shrinksafe][2] using tusk:

    tusk install jake
    tusk install shrinksafe
